//6.Write code to make a copy of the people array using slice. The copy should NOT include “Mary” or your name.

//7.Write code that console.logs Mary’s index. take a look at indexOf on google.

//8.Write code that gives the indexOf “Foo” (this should return -1). Why does it return -1
//It returns -1 because foo is not in the array

//9.Create a variable called last which value is the last element of the array.
